    <preresearch>A network of bases and spaceports that would allow effective
    repair of spacecrafts. It also serves as refuelling station for our
    ships.</preresearch>

    <description>Repair Facility is actually net of the smaller and larger
    landing pads and airstrips that cover all planet. This allows pilot to
    choose the station closest to him and be repaired quickly. These
    facilities usually contain tools necessary to fix the aircraft and few
    reserve pilots in case of some injury. While effective, repair of
    spacecrafts is a difficult thing and takes some time, despite the
    conditions and technology. Repair of larger crafts is fast too, but it is
    impossible to have some many spare parts ready and some must be
    manufactured on the spot.</description>

    <flavor>Empire in its arrogance aimed to win every battle with one
    decisive strike and hence allmost no repair bases were built. This
    weakness was soon exploited by rebel generals. Large ships that were able
    to withstand major beating were being continuously repaired and Imperial
    fleet was soon overcame with much more inferior fleet.</flavor>

    <preresearch>When morale starts to threaten your domain, it is time, to do
    something about it. Either fix the people or fix the reasons for given
    disorder. Entertainment center tries to do the latter.</preresearch>

    <description>Entertainment centers are, as the name suggests, places where
    colonists can find some pleasure and spent their leisure time. In more
    civilized parts of the universe, entertainment is more noble, like
    theaters, galleries and alike. It is the simple matter of demand and
    supply. These entertainment centers simply try to make people happy.
    Relieving them of their hardships, they are more likely to be content and
    less likely to revolt. Especially on border systems, where contact with
    the rest of the galaxy is rare and people are unlikely to organize
    anything for themselves, these structures are very
    important.</description>

    <flavor>One of the most popular computer games to be found in the
    entertainment centers across the Sheng sector was called Doom XI. An
    excellent virtual reality 3D shooter, this was the GAME. While the
    official version was perfectly harmless with any sustained 'damage' felt
    only as a added presure of VR suit, the enigma 1.3 patch changed this game
    into a death-risk reality. The pain was real(induced through neural
    receptors, the wounds were not) and when you died, the brain was
    intentionally overloaded and player died too. Illeagal tournaments, bets,
    random accidents, suicides, it all was extremly appealing to the bored
    population of Sheng systems and thus, the governor felt no need to do
    anything against it. Unfortunately, one enlightened hacker managed to
    insert enigma patch with die-or-win-only feature to his personal VR set.
    Governor made it to level 17...</flavor>
