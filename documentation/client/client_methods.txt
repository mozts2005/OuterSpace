Methods used in: client-pygame/lib/osci/client.py

I am going over the normally used commands first, then the lesser used commands. A few I have skipped 
becuase they aren't used except internally to the core server. --RC


Main Commands:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

keepAlive: calls "getMessages" command. Can be forced (pass True).


get: The most common method used to retrieve object information:
- objID: id of the object to 'get'
- forceUpdate: set to 1 to force the command to query the server rather than first checking the local DB
- noUpdate: set to 1 to force the command to just return the DB entry if it exists, or None
- canBePublic: set to 0 to force the command to only query owner data rather than public data
- publicOnly: set to 1 to force the command to only query the public data rather than owner data

* If you use noUpdate, then using the other three are meaningless.
* If you don't use forceUpdate, then it tries to grab the data locally first.
* Public data is defined as any data that is publically available (that is, based on your scanner view)
* Owner data is any data where you, the player, owns it (or you are logged in as an admin)

* If publicOnly is not set and you call client.get without being the owner, it will first query the owner 
method, then the public method, doubling the time to query the data. Therefore, if you know you are never 
the play, MAKE SURE you specify publicOnly=1

* Getting owner data calls: cmdProxy.getInfo(...)
* Getting public data calls: cmdProxy.getPublicInfo(...)


updateIDs: deletes all objecs and requeries

getRelationTo: queries the passed object ID (objID) for diplomatic relations of the current player; returns the relationship (see Const.py on server)

getTurn: returns current turn

getFullTechInfo: returns the tech from the Rules.techs list (the parsed XML files)

getTechInfo: returns the tech based on what current player knows of the tech based on that account's tech research

getAllTechIDs: returns the IDs of all techs from Rules.techs's keys

getPlayerID: returns the current player's ID

getDiplomacyWith: returns current pacts of the passed object ID (contactID), or returns default pacts if unknown

getMessages: loads new forum messages

getMessagesLastID: internally used in getMessages
