    <preresearch>When the size of an empire grows, so grows the need for
    control and formal organization. Government Center is an absolute need for
    any larger nation.</preresearch>

    <description>After the fall of the Empire, new nations emerge. Former
    governers, military commanders, local influential politicians, charismatic
    leaders - these are the people that rule single, isolated colonies. As the
    domain and influence grows, so grows the need for administration, for
    authority and respect. For every nation, goverment center looks different,
    as is the political system they maintain. Its local names vary -
    Parliament, Royal castle, Governor's house, Imperial council, Convent, but
    in the end, the results are the same. Huge complexes of administrative
    buildings, infinite number of bureaucrats and usually a place where
    executive power of the nation resides. Also, the destruction of the center
    is usually the same. Turmoil all over the terittory. Larger the nation,
    greater the danger of beaking it apart or splitting into many independent
    systems.</description>

    <flavor>Seat of the former emperor was on a planet, whose name has long
    been forgotten(altough rebels dubbed it The Black Star). The exact
    location of the system likewise. While location is unknown, there are many
    legends of its size and complexity. One of them tells us, that the entire
    planetary mass has been transformed into one gigantic administrative and
    living complexes, that there were no other things on this planet.
    High-capacity transportation systems were sustaining every need of the
    planet, and this legend says that seven fully expanded earthlike planets
    were necessary to feed it. In exchange, the planet controlled virtually
    whole known universe. Soon after the open revolution began, rebels soon
    captured hyperspace-jump capable cruiser. Then, the legend says, they
    stacked the cruiser with planet class D-bombs and attempted a suicidal
    jump directly into the planetary mass(an act forbidden by every possible
    weapons treaty in existence). Protective hyperspace inhibitors did work
    correctly and the cruiser was unable to phase out into the the planet
    itself(being effectively trapped), but this did not save the planet.
    Rebels triggered the bombs and the resulting explosion ripped very fabric
    of hyperspace apart and sent massive shockwaves throughout the central
    system, wasting the planet and an entire defending fleet. Altough
    spectacular and teoretically possible, much more credible seems another
    version that tells us, that primary seat of power was simply cut from its
    food suplies through few terrorist attack using bio-weapons on those seven
    earthlike planets.</flavor>

    small amout of population, including manufacturing capabilities, mining
    and internal food production.</preresearch>

    <description>A basic colonization unit widely used throughout the empire
    before the Fall. When colony ship lands, its converts itself into this
    self-sustained large complex of buildings. Outpost contains a small-scale
    nuclear powerplant. Altough effective and without any requirements, it
    cannot support the needs of whole colony. Also within the complex, there
    is a drilling machine to provide the outpost with minerals for
    construction. Food is grown in large internally heated environmentally
    independent domes. The last and for new colonies most important is an
    assembly workshop capable of producing basic buildings and spacecrafts.
    While useful and without any requirements, life in the outpost is
    unpleasant. It's many functions requires twice the number of people, that
    would produce the same things in specialized buildings.</description>

    <flavor>While reliable and constant, quality and taste of hydroponic

    <preresearch>Manufacturing facilities are among the most basic structures.
    Everything is created in them. They employ about a half of Outpost and are
    twice as productive.</preresearch>

    <description>Factory, as the name suggests is the group of several huge
    halls that contain everything necessary to manufacture any product
    necessary. If you own raw materials. Giant cranes, assembly lines,
    smelting pots. All this produce great amount of pollution and waste. Toxic
    fumes from towering smoke-stacks cloud the sky and make air hard to
    breathe, if breathable at all. Underground waters are also being spoilt.
    Even when the halls are vacant and there is nothing to do, machines
    require maintainance and repairs. Energy and minerals are needed to
    support them. When these are short in supply, factories slowly
    deteoriate.</description>

    <flavor>The most dreadful thing, I have ever seen is a planet reduced to a
    lifeless hulk by rows of factories and smoke-stacks that produce
    war-equipment. Sky changes its color to black and sun never comes up. This

    <preresearch>Large scale energy production is necessary for every
    industrial planet where sunshine is not abundant.</preresearch>

    <description>A primitive, but effective way of producing energy. In times
    following the Fall, Oil powerplants were the most common of powerplants.
    Large-scale nuclear reactors were used much much later after that. These
    powerplants uses petroleum, gas or any similiar substance, that can be
    mined on the planet. No minerals mean no power here. Minerals are refined,
    cleaned and burned to power giant turbines that in turn generate
    electricity with up to 80% effectivity. These powerplants are cheap, easy
    to manufacture and very effective, but where solar power is available, it
    is used instead. This has only one reason - pollution. Altough only one or
    two plants are neccessary per planet, the impact on naturarakl balance is
    tremendous and very negative.</description>

    <flavor>A ritual of walking the turbine blade is strictly forbidden, but
    still practiced in many powerplants in this region as the way of a
    punishment for moral and ethic crimes that are just desired to be kept
    within the place. There is a strange sense of honor among the workers in
    these dirty powerplants. Just when the turbine is starting after
    maintanance pauses, the offender is forced to jump from blade to blade to
    get to opposite emergency exit. Fatality rate of such stroll is enormous -
    up to 80%. Most linger too long on the blades and fall down. The rest
    estimate the jumps wrongly and slip during landing. --personnal diary

    <preresearch>Absolutely necessary structure on any living planet. Farm
    should produce food and improve local ecology slowly.</preresearch>

    <description>Farms are perhaps the most common sites or constructions on
    any living planet. The actual appearance and function of the farms on any
    particular planet is slightly different. For earthlike planets, it is
    obvious... large fields with various crops. Mostly traditional, if
    genetically engineered, plants from the old Empire or new of new origin.
    Where possible, scientists try to adapt local plant life for needs of
    population. This method, while effective, leads sometimes to virulent
    diseases that are able to wipe entire systems before the infection is
    stopped - or dies out as it happens.</description>

    <flavor>"Subterran farms on planet Sigil Beta used to produce very very
    special and rare fungi that causes long-lasting sensations of happiness
    and ecstacy and ... a deep uncousciousness. While first thought to be
    useless and preparations for imported plantlife began, the fungi became
    the greatest export article of the planet. After Sigils change of
    allegiance, rebels used this drug few times in combat sucessfully. The
    Empire responded by testing new anti planetary D-bombs on Sigil Beta. Also
    to a great success. Sigil was reduced to uninhabitable collection of
    asteroids, none larger than 500 km in diameter.", from 'The Rise and the

    <description>Research bases are scientific compounds built all over the
    planet. These structures vary, depending on planetary conditions. On large
    earthlike planets, these bases are more theoretical, whereas on hostile or
    other alien planets, these bases concern themselves with local ecosystem
    or perhaps local artifacts and technology found there(quite frequent, when
    you consider the fact that allmost every planet was populated before the
    Fall). While new research is being constantly done, its roots and origins
    lie mostly within the boundaries of ancient technology of the past. It
    will take hundreds of years for humanity - or whatever follows humanity -
    to reach and finally surpass its past.</description>

    <flavor>The Empire was very strict and single-minded when dealing with
    technology and science. All scientific research in areas such physics,
    engineering or construction was supervised by the Empire. Also, sudden
    disappearences of top scientists were quite common. Researcher left the
    lab and another morning, he was nowhere to be found and his laboratory was
    struck by fire. Such was life of the past. One could note, that more
    spiritual fields of study were left undisturbed, where they didn't
    interfere with doctrine, politics or so. While this was drawing to the end
    pre-Fall as brain studies were coming closer and closer to some important
    discoveries, this lack of insight was one of the roots of the
    rebellion.</flavor>

    <flavor>'Existence of invisible ships is an unconfirmed legend among Space
    Scanner operators. The fact is, that such technology has yet to appear. On
    the other hand, it has happened more than once, that an incoming fleet was
    marked as friendly and it was too late to cry when the fleet markings were
    visible to the naked eye as that usually meant the markings were seen on
    falling bombs and from uniforms of enemy soldiers. These accidents are
    caused either by technology sabotage or a faulty software. As enginners
    responsible for the latter are nowhere to be found, the error is bound to
    appear again and again.', Galaxy Times, star date 1023:20, short text on

    <description>Solar powerplant consists usually of one large Energy
    collector and hunderds of square kilometers of solar panes, that lie
    either on the ground or in some small height, supported by steel
    construction. It is evident, that solar panels are very fragile and prone
    to damage - especially bombing damage. Large energy collectors are used to
    cover energy comsumption during anomal sun activities, violent winds,
    cloudy skies and other disturbances. It would be possible for a plant to
    run at perhaps 180% effectivity during normal periods, but factories would

    Research in this field will raise our dependency on minerals and lower our
    dependency on biomatter eventually. When we improve this technology
    enough, we can advance to the next technological level.</preresearch>
